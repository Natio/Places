Project developed for the Google Technologies for Cloud and Web Development Workshop 2014 held in Rome.

Places is a new kind of social network, where people are invited to go out and discover the hidden soul made of people's memories and thoughts that every places holds.

It is currently in development for Android platforms.

You share text, photos, and other media (coming soon) with others, and your Flag will belong to the place and time it has been posted in forever.

You are very welcome to download the source code and build it. Remember that Places is still in early stage of development, so new features are added as they are implemented.

If you have questions regarding Places, feel free to contact us ;)
