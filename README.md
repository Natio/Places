Project developed for the Google Technologies for Cloud and Web Development Workshop 2014 held in Rome.

Places is a new concept of social network. People can leave their thoughts everywhere, their feelings, and others can find them. In this way users are building the history of places.

It is currently in development phase for Android platform.

You share text, photos, and other media (coming soon) with others, and your Flag will belong to the place and time it has been posted in forever.
